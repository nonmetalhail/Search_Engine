Search_Engine
=============

This is a search engine created in Python. I made it as part of a homework assignment for Info 206: Distributed Computing Applications and Infrastructure, Spring 2012. 

It is composed of a crawler which crawls the UC Berkeley I School website, while adhering to the robots.txt file. It then creates an inverted index of scrapped terms, weighting title text terms for more than regular body text. A user can then enter a query and the search engine returns a HTML page of links which best match that query.
